This is a simple weather application created using Javascript. In this application I used Accuweather free API. So, There are some limitation. As accuweather provide only 50 API request/Day so our application will not work after limit is excedded.

If you want then you can download the project and change the API key and experiment into it. ðŸ’šGood Luck!ðŸ’š
